/**
 * Stand-alone Java file for processing the database CSV files.
 * <p>
 * You can run this file using the "Run" or "Debug" options
 * from within VSCode. This won't conflict with the web server.
 * <p>
 * This program opens a CSV file from the Closing-the-Gap data set
 * and uses JDBC to load up data into the database.
 * <p>
 * To use this program you will need to change:
 * 1. The input file location
 * 2. The output file location
 * <p>
 * This assumes that the CSV files are the the **database** folder.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: This code may take quite a while to run as there will be a lot
 * of SQL insert statments!
